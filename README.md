# tic-tac-toe

A tic-tac-toe game created with Javascript IIFE modules

## Reflection
major concepts exercised:
- closures
- designing IIFE modules for namespacing & encapsulation
- factory functions
- designing separation of logic
- responsiveness with relative css units


the brainstorming was very tough for the tic-tac-toe project. the hardest part was figuring out how to design which parts you need and what information they return such that it's all "logical", non-redundant, and retains as much privacy as possible. but i learned a lot about how to do it and how a display module should work in relation to inner controls; it's like the previous Library project but taken to the extreme. Time spent: About 38 hours
